## Files and Folders

*./src* - contains the QMD report file overviewing the data engineering tool landscape in 2024 and the relation of certain toolsets to bioinformatics.

*./samples* - contains several sample QMD files to aid in learning how to render with quarto as well as the different possibilities with QMD rendering.

*./docs* - contains resulting files from quarto render operations.  *NEVER directly store files in ./docs.* Rather, let Quarto maintain the contents of the *./docs* folder using settings in the quarto project file, *_quarto.yml*
