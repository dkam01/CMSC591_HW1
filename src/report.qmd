# Open Source Data Engineering Tools

Author Alireza Sadeghi offers a nice overview of the [2024 ata engineering landscape](https://practicaldataengineering.substack.com/p/open-source-data-engineering-landscape) in the on-line web site [Practical Data Engineering Substack](https://practicaldataengineering.substack.com/).

# Major Categories

Mr. Sadeghi proposals nine major tools categories.

## Storage Systems

Storage systems are foundational components in data engineering that handle the storage and retrieval of data. These systems can include traditional databases, distributed storage solutions, and modern cloud-based storage options. They provide scalable, reliable, and secure environments to store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, ensuring data is accessible for processing, analysis, and other operations.

## Data Lake Platform

Data Lake platforms are designed to store vast amounts of raw data in its native format until it is needed. Unlike traditional databases, data lakes can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, providing a flexible and scalable storage solution. These platforms support the integration of multiple data sources, making it easier to perform big data analytics and machine learning on large datasets.

# Digging into the details

In the following sections I identify three subcategories of data engineering tools of greatest interest to me.

## Relational OLTP DBMS

This section is provided as an example.  You MAY NOT submit *relational OLTP DBMS* as part of your project 1!

**Relational Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Database Management Systems (DBMS)** are designed to manage and execute a large number of short, transactional operations that involve the insertion, update, and deletion of data in a relational database. These systems are optimized for environments where data integrity, consistency, and speed are critical due to the high volume of concurrent transactions.

### Unique Characteristics of Relational OLTP DBMS:

1. **Structured Data Storage:**
   - Data is stored in a structured format using tables that define specific schemas, with rows representing records and columns representing attributes of the data.
   - The use of primary and foreign keys enforces relationships between different tables, maintaining data integrity across the database.

2. **ACID Compliance:**
   - OLTP systems are designed to be ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). This ensures that all transactions are processed reliably, even in the event of a system failure.
   - Atomicity guarantees that all parts of a transaction are completed; otherwise, the transaction is aborted.
   - Consistency ensures that each transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
   - Isolation keeps transactions separated until they are completed, preventing concurrency issues.
   - Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanently recorded in the database, even in the case of a power failure.

3. **Concurrency Control:**
   - OLTP systems employ sophisticated concurrency control mechanisms, such as locking and transaction isolation levels, to manage simultaneous data access by multiple users or processes.
   - These mechanisms prevent conflicts and ensure that transactions are executed in a consistent and reliable manner, even under heavy load.

4. **High Availability and Reliability:**
   - OLTP databases are designed for environments that require high availability and reliability. They often include features such as replication, clustering, and failover to ensure continuous operation even during hardware or network failures.
   - Backup and recovery mechanisms are also integral to these systems, ensuring that data can be restored to a consistent state in the event of a failure.

5. **Scalability:**
   - While traditionally OLTP systems were scaled vertically by adding more resources to a single server, modern OLTP DBMS solutions support horizontal scaling, enabling distributed transactions across multiple servers or nodes.
   - Distributed OLTP systems can handle a larger number of transactions by partitioning data and processing load across multiple instances.

### Usage of Relational OLTP DBMS:

1. **Business Applications:**
   
   OLTP systems are widely used in business applications that require the processing of large volumes of simple, repetitive transactions, such as order processing, inventory management, financial transactions, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
   
   Examples include e-commerce platforms, banking systems, and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software.

2. **Real-Time Transaction Processing:**

   OLTP systems are ideal for applications requiring real-time data entry, updates, and querying, where the accuracy and speed of transactions directly impact business operations.

   They are often used in industries such as finance, telecommunications, retail, and healthcare, where real-time data processing is critical.

3. **Data Integrity and Consistency:**
   
   OLTP databases are crucial in environments where data integrity and consistency are non-negotiable. For example, in financial systems, it is vital that all transactions are recorded accurately and that balances reflect all processed transactions immediately.

4. **User-Driven Querying:**
   
   OLTP systems support user-driven querying, allowing end-users to retrieve and interact with data through applications in real-time. These queries are typically simple and involve accessing specific records or performing updates on existing data.

### Examples of Open-Source Relational OLTP DBMS:

**PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system that is known for its robustness, extensibility, and support for complex queries and transactions.

**MySQL:** A widely-used open-source relational database known for its ease of use, reliability, and performance, particularly in web-based applications.

**MariaDB:** A fork of MySQL, MariaDB is designed to be highly compatible with MySQL while offering additional features and performance improvements.

**SQLite:** A lightweight, embedded SQL database engine that is self-contained and requires minimal setup, commonly used in mobile apps and small to medium-sized applications.

These relational OLTP DBMS tools are foundational in many organizations, ensuring that transactional data is handled efficiently and reliably, forming the backbone of countless business operations worldwide.
